# Tech Stack- Web App with full CRUD using Node.js, Express, EJS and Mongo, deployed to Heroku

# Prerequisites
JavaScript
Express / Node

# Expected Functionality (MVP)
- User can learn how to write haikus with the haiku helper.
- User can add/edit/delete haikus on web app
- User can view their haikus on the Haiku Wall

# Index Page ("The Haiku Wall")
The app should have a wall page (graffi-like inspired by the Lennon Wall) where
all the haikus are displayed

# Show Page
Show page should display a haiku with a link back to the Wall Page, a link to edit (goes to the edit page), a delete button that deletes the haiku.

# Edit & New Page
These views should render forms and submit to the appropriate routes.

# Redirects
The create route should redirect to the index.

The delete route should redirect to the index.

The update route will redirect back to the quote's show page.

# What is Haiku?
Haiku is a style of poetry originated from Japan.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku

# Why Haiku?
Haiku peoms are terse, elegant & descriptive, just like good clean code.

Learning & writing haiku will help a coder write better elegant clean code. :)

# One Haiku Poem

# old pond
# frog leaps in
# water's sound

by Basho (1644â€“1694) who is considered the best haiku poet ever.

# Traditional Haiku Structure

The structure of a traditional haiku is always the same, including the following features:

There are only three lines, totaling 17 syllables.

The first line is 5 syllables.

The second line is 7 syllables.

The third line is 5 syllables like the first.

Punctuation and capitalization are up to the poet, and need not follow the rigid rules used in structuring sentences.

A haiku does not have to rhyme, in fact usually it does not rhyme at all.

It can include the repetition of words or sounds

# Steps for Writing a Haiku
Even though there are specific rules for writing a traditional haiku, the process can still be fun and rewarding. And remember that a modern haiku can be more freeform.

If you are wondering how to write a haiku for the first time, consider the following steps:

Begin by reading examples of haiku - there are some below - to help you get inspired about the subjects and construction of haiku. A haiku is a beautiful form of poetry, so take time to appreciate it before you begin writing it. You can find more examples of haiku poems on YourDictionary or in your local library.

Create a list of possible subjects that you might write about, considering various aspects of nature that inspire you. Consider traditional subjects like animals, nature, and seasons, or something completely different. Even the smallest details can make for great haiku.

After you choose a subject, you may want to look at a few pictures of it, or go outside and admire it. Like all of the great poets before you, some of the greatest inspiration comes from simply admiring nature and the world around them.

Make a list of words that relate to the subject you have chosen. Be as descriptive as possible. Think about feelings and emotions too.

The last line is usually used to make an observation about your subject. It can be fun to add a surprise here. Looking through the list you wrote, can you create an unexpected relationship between the first two lines and the third?

Decide if you want to write using the 5-7-5 rule or branch outside the limits of this pattern. (If you have trouble determining the syllables in a word because you are not sure how to pronounce it, you can look up the word here on YourDictionary for a count of the syllables.)

# Examples of Traditional Haiku
The most famed traditional Japanese poets include Matsuo Basho, Yosa Buson, Kobayashi Issa, and Masoaka Shiki. They are known as "the Great Four" and their work is still the model for traditional haiku writing today.

Let's take a look at two of Matsuo Basho's most famous poems. (Note: The 5-7-5 rhythm has been lost in translation, as not every Japanese word has the same number of syllables, or sounds, as its English version. For example, haiku has two syllables in English. In Japanese, the word has three sounds.)

An old silent pond,
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

On a withered branch
A crow has alighted:
Nightfall in autumn.

The traditional form of haiku has also been embraced by English-speaking poets. Here are two examples by Kelly Roper from our sister site LoveToKnow.com, both with a focus on nature.

The season gives way.
Winter lays down her mantle,
As spring bursts to life

Waiting in the marsh,
The heron stands silently,
Fish sense death is near.

# Examples of Modern Haiku
Now, let's take a look at modern Western haiku. Here are two examples, also by LoveToKnow's Kelly Roper. Notice the difference in style compared to the traditional haiku examples above.

Foul ball
Flys up through the air...
Fan catches it with his face.

Giant, foul-smelling shadow
Smashing through the forest.
Sasquatch is on the move.

Although many modern poets don't follow the 5-7-5 pattern, you will still come across a few who remain true to the original form.

# Process of Writing a Beautiful Haiku
Reading through examples of haiku can help you understand and appreciate haiku before you write one yourself. Reading haiku to children can also help them develop a sense of how to interpret poetry, and begin the process of writing their own simple poems.

Remember to be creative, not only with your use of words but also with your punctuation and word order. A haiku is not designed to read like a sentence, so do not feel bound by normal capitalization and structure rules.

# Teach Kids How to Write Haiku
To teach kids how to write haiku, an educator should begin by explaining what haiku is, how it is constructed, and share examples of this poetry.

# Explaining Haiku
Haiku is a form of poetry that began in Japan. Haiku uses the senses to describe scenes from nature, and often involves vivid images of trees, plants, seasons, and other elements of the natural world.

A haiku is comprised of three lines, and a total of 17 syllables, broken up into a five-seven-five rule:

five syllables on the first line

seven syllables on the second line

five syllables on the third line

Because haiku by design is a simple form of poetry, it is an excellent place for young writers to begin and hone their skills as budding poets. Educators can teach kids how to write haiku by following a few simple steps:

Explain what haiku is and how it is a brilliant way to express the beauty that is in nature.

Point out the five-seven-five rule regarding the syllable construction of haiku. Make sure that your students understand how to determine syllables in words, and review with them how to use a dictionary to find syllables when necessary.

To help students with syllables, have them clap the words of each line of a haiku, and count with each clap.

Have students write down potential subjects for their haiku. Because haiku describes the natural world, have them write a list of subjects, which can include animals, seasons, physical scenes, and more.

Once your students have determined the subject and title for their haiku, have them begin writing lists of words that describe their subject. Of course not all of these terms will be utilized in their final poem, but a robust and descriptive list will give them a lot of words to choose from when drafting their haiku.

Have them begin with their first line of five syllables. Teach your kids to describe ideas, be as vivid as possible, rather than trying to construct sentences or complete thoughts.

As they proceed to their second, and longer line of seven syllables, your students will want to further the idea captured by the haiku. Remember to use ample praise and to guide them when they are stuck, offering suggestions for word usage.

When they finish their haiku with the third line of five syllables, remind them that this line can be one or two words, and again, that they should aim for simplicity.

# Example of a Haiku
To have your students understand and appreciate haiku, you should share with them several examples of this form of poetry. Here is a sample haiku by acclaimed Japanese poet Basho:

An old silent pond...

A frog jumps into the pond, splash!

Silence again.

You can also share with your class haiku that you or previous students have written, and remind them of the simplicity and beauty of all haiku, regardless of its authoring.

# Capture Imagination
To teach kids how to write haiku, try to use encouragement, rewards, and to capture their imagination throughout the process. You can do this by beautifully publishing their haiku, and having the student decorate the poem with scenes appropriate to their subject matter.

Here are a few ways that you can "publish" your students' decorated haiku poetry:

Have haiku mounted on construction paper and other decorative paper, and post it on a bulletin board in your school or classroom.

Create a booklet with all of your students' haiku and distribute it to your class for them to share with their parents and others.

Use haiku in cards or invitations for family members and others.

Teachers should be enthusiastic about haiku's beauty, and help students fall in love with this form of poetry.
